# Manning Chassis and Template: Configure Observability

**In this liveProject, I learned how to implement the following key observability patterns.**

+ Health check API: A service exposes a health check API endpoint, such as GET /health, which returns the health of the service.

+ Application metrics: Services report metrics to a central server that provides aggregation, visualization, and alerting.

+ Distributed tracing: Assign each external request a unique ID and record how it flows through the system from one service to the next in a centralized server that provides visualization and analysis.
